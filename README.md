 # Python script to automate the change of desktop background
A python script that automates the process of changing the desktop background. I am a kind of moody person and was fond of my wallpaper collection that had many images which I used to change as my desktop background too often, manually. It was time-consuming work to do so, I thought of making this script that could automate the process of changing 
my desktop background from the folder of my wallpaper collection.
