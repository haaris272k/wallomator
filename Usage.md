  # There are three ways of executing the script
    1> You can directly execute the main script by clicking on the batch (.bat file) and it will keep on working at the background.
    
    2> You can make the .vbs file to run at the startup by configuring some settings in the registery editor. The 
       script will automatcially get executed at the system startup.
       
    3> You can also use the task scheduler to execute the script with the help of batch file.
    
    
   *Note: Don't forget to change the path as per your your system*
