### Method 4: Convert to Executable

1. **Convert to Executable**:
   - You can convert the Python script into an executable (.exe) file using tools like PyInstaller, cx_Freeze or any other such tool.
   - Once converted, you can run the executable directly without relying on Python.

**Note: Please ensure that you update the file paths within the script to match your system's configuration.**
